## Running Locally

Copy the definitions from [`.env.example`](https://github.com/hypermodeAI/hyper-commerce-frontend/blob/main/.env.example) into a new file named `.env.local` at the root of your project, and provide the values from your Hypermode dashboard.

Once your environment variables are configured, install the necessary dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the development server using:

```
npm run dev
```

Your app should be up and running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
